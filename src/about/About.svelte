        Howdy! I'm <strong>Jos√© Barrientos</strong> and I've been developing for the better
        part of the last 4 years. I lived in Australia for three years improving my english,
        and during my time down-under I also had the opportunity to meet all sorts of interesting
        people, while also working in a lot of different jobs, which I think gives me a lot
        of perspective when working in team-oriented, fast-paced environments.

        I recently moved back to Argentina and now I'm working as a chapter lead at
        <a class="link" href="https://www.scalemote.co/">Scalemote</a>, providing
        technical assistance to developers working in different projects, setting
        standards for building performing, scaling and maintanable code, and interacting
        with clients and project managers to avoid obstacles, break barriers, and deliver
        high-quality products and services.
